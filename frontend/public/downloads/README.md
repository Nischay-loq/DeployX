# DeployX Agent Installer Placeholder

This directory contains the DeployX agent installer.

## Instructions:
1. Place your actual `deployx-agent.exe` file in this directory
2. The download button on the landing page will link to `/downloads/deployx-agent.exe`
3. Make sure the file is named exactly `deployx-agent.exe`

## Current Status:
- Directory created: ✅
- Agent installer file: ⚠️ **Please add your .exe file here**

The download link is already configured in the Hero component and will work once you add the actual installer file.
