# DeployX Scheduling System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive scheduling system for DeployX that allows users to schedule:
- **Command Execution** - Schedule commands to run on devices/groups
- **Software Deployment** - Schedule software installations at specific times
- **File Deployment** - Schedule file distributions to devices

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Flexible Scheduling Options**
- **One-time execution** - Run once at a specific date/time
- **Daily** - Repeat every day at a specific time
- **Weekly** - Repeat on specific days of the week
- **Monthly** - Repeat on a specific day of the month
- **Custom cron** - Advanced scheduling with cron expressions

### 2. **Complete Task Management**
- Create, read, update, delete scheduled tasks
- Pause and resume tasks
- Manually trigger tasks (execute now)
- View execution history with detailed results
- Task status tracking (pending, running, completed, failed, etc.)

### 3. **Full Integration**
- Integrates with existing command execution system
- Integrates with software deployment system
- Integrates with file deployment system
- Respects user permissions and device groups
- Creates standard deployment records for tracking

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

1. **`backend/app/schedule/models.py`**
   - Database models for scheduled tasks and execution history
   - Pydantic schemas for API requests/responses
   - Task types, status enums, and recurrence types

2. **`backend/app/schedule/scheduler.py`**
   - Core scheduling service using APScheduler
   - Task execution logic for all three task types
   - Trigger configuration for different recurrence patterns
   - Background task execution with error handling

3. **`backend/app/schedule/routes.py`**
   - Complete REST API for task management
   - Endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Task control (pause, resume, execute)
   - Execution history and statistics

4. **`backend/app/schedule/__init__.py`**
   - Module initialization

5. **`backend/SCHEDULING_GUIDE.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - API examples and use cases
   - Best practices and troubleshooting

6. **`backend/create_schedule_tables.py`**
   - Database migration script
   - Creates scheduling tables

### Modified Files:

1. **`backend/app/main.py`**
   - Added schedule router import
   - Registered schedule routes
   - Added startup/shutdown events for scheduler
   - Loads existing tasks on startup

2. **`backend/requirements.txt`**
   - Added `apscheduler` dependency

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create Database Tables
```bash
cd backend
python create_schedule_tables.py
```

Or the tables will be auto-created when you start the server.

### 3. Start the Server
The scheduler will automatically start with the application:
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:socket_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Database Schema

### `scheduled_tasks` Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `task_name` - Name of the task
- `task_type` - command, software_deployment, or file_deployment
- `status` - pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled, paused
- `scheduled_time` - When to execute
- `recurrence_type` - once, daily, weekly, monthly, custom
- `recurrence_config` - JSON configuration for recurrence
- `device_ids` - JSON array of target device IDs
- `group_ids` - JSON array of target group IDs
- `payload` - JSON task-specific data
- `created_by` - User who created the task
- `created_at`, `updated_at` - Timestamps
- `last_execution`, `next_execution` - Execution tracking
- `execution_count` - Number of times executed
- `last_result`, `error_message` - Result tracking

### `scheduled_task_executions` Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `task_id` - Foreign key to scheduled_tasks
- `execution_time` - When execution started
- `completed_time` - When execution finished
- `status` - Execution status
- `deployment_id` - Link to deployment record
- `result` - JSON execution result
- `error_message` - Error details if failed

## Architecture

### Scheduler Service (`scheduler.py`)
- Uses APScheduler for background task execution
- Runs in asyncio mode for non-blocking execution
- Handles task lifecycle (schedule, reschedule, cancel, pause, resume)
- Converts recurrence configurations to APScheduler triggers
- Executes tasks asynchronously with proper error handling

### Task Execution Flow
1. User creates scheduled task via API
2. Task is saved to database
3. Scheduler adds job to APScheduler
4. At scheduled time, job triggers execution
5. Scheduler creates execution record
6. Appropriate deployment system is called (command/software/file)
7. Execution result is recorded
8. For recurring tasks, next execution is scheduled

### Integration Points
- **Command Execution**: Uses `group_command_executor` for parallel/batch execution
- **Software Deployment**: Creates `Deployment` and `DeploymentTarget` records
- **File Deployment**: Creates `FileDeployment` records and triggers file transfer

## Key Benefits

1. **Automation** - Set it and forget it task scheduling
2. **Flexibility** - Multiple recurrence patterns supported
3. **Visibility** - Full execution history and status tracking
4. **Control** - Pause, resume, or manually trigger tasks
5. **Integration** - Seamlessly works with existing systems
6. **User Isolation** - Each user can only see/manage their own tasks
7. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error tracking and logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create a One-Time Task** - Test basic scheduling
2. **Test Different Recurrence Types** - Daily, weekly, monthly
3. **Test Pause/Resume** - Verify task control works
4. **Test Manual Execution** - Trigger tasks immediately
5. **Test with Different Task Types** - Command, software, file
6. **Check Execution History** - Verify results are recorded
7. **Test with Groups** - Ensure group targeting works
8. **Test Error Scenarios** - Invalid devices, offline agents, etc.

## Monitoring

Monitor scheduler status through:
- **API Stats Endpoint**: `/api/schedule/stats`
- **Task Status**: Check individual task status
- **Execution History**: Review past executions
- **Server Logs**: APScheduler logs all job executions

## Troubleshooting

### Scheduler Not Starting
- Check server logs for errors during startup
- Verify APScheduler dependency is installed
- Ensure database tables are created

### Tasks Not Executing
- Verify task status is "pending" not "paused"
- Check scheduled_time is in the future (for once tasks)
- Review server logs for scheduler errors
- Verify devices/groups exist and are accessible

### Execution Failures
- Check execution history for error messages
- Verify target devices are online
- Test the task manually first (execute now)
- Review deployment logs for the specific type

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Email/webhook notifications on task completion/failure
- Task templates for common scenarios
- Bulk task operations
- Task dependencies (task chains)
- Execution time windows
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Task scheduling calendar view in frontend
- Task duplication feature
- Task export/import

## Security Considerations

- ✅ User authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Users can only manage their own tasks
- ✅ Device/group access respects existing permissions
- ✅ Task payloads are validated before execution
- ✅ All operations are logged

## Performance Notes

- APScheduler runs in background without blocking main app
- Maximum 3 concurrent instances of same job prevents overload
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- Async execution prevents blocking server threads
- Completed tasks can be archived/deleted to maintain performance
