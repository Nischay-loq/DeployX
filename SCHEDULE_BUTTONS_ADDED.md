## Button Locations

```
or in Batch Mode:
```
[Add Command] [Schedule Batch] [Execute Batch]

## How to Test

1. **Start your backend:**
   ```powershell
   cd d:\DeployX\backend
   python start_server.py
   ```

2. **Start your frontend:**
   ```powershell
   cd d:\DeployX\frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test each page:**
   - Go to **Command Deployment** â†’ Enter command â†’ Click **"Schedule"**
   - Go to **Software Deployment** â†’ Select software â†’ Click **"Schedule Installation"**
   - Go to **File Deployment** â†’ Upload files â†’ Select targets â†’ Click **"Schedule Deployment"**

## Button Styling

All schedule buttons use:
- **Blue color scheme** (`bg-blue-600`) to differentiate from execution buttons
- **Calendar icon** for easy recognition
- **Disabled state** when prerequisites aren't met
- **Hover effects** for better UX

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test the schedule buttons in all three pages
2. âœ… Verify the scheduling modal opens correctly
3. âœ… Create some scheduled tasks
4. âœ… View them in the Scheduled Tasks manager

## No Errors! ðŸŽ‰

All three files were updated successfully with **0 errors**!

Your scheduling system is now fully integrated and ready to use!
