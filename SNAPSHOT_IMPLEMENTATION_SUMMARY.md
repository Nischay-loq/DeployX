# Snapshot and Rollback System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A comprehensive snapshot and rollback system for the DeployX agent that automatically captures system state before command execution and enables easy rollback when needed.

## Key Features

### ✅ Automatic Snapshot Creation
- Creates snapshots before each command execution
- Captures file system state intelligently based on command
- Supports both single commands and batches
- Maintains persistent shell context for batch commands

### ✅ Intelligent Monitoring
- Automatically detects paths affected by commands
- Monitors:
  - Current working directory (always)
  - Target directories for `mkdir`, `cd`, `rm`, etc.
  - Parent directories of created/deleted files
  
### ✅ Complete Rollback Support
- **Single Command Rollback**: Restore state for individual commands
- **Batch Rollback**: Rollback entire batches in reverse order
- **File Operations**:
  - Restores modified files from backup
  - Removes newly created files
  - Restores deleted files
  - Preserves permissions and timestamps

### ✅ Automatic Cleanup
- Snapshots automatically deleted after 24 hours (configurable)
- Background cleanup task runs periodically
- Manual cleanup available via API
- Prevents disk space issues

### ✅ Backend Integration
- Socket.io event handlers for all operations
- Real-time progress updates
- Complete error handling and reporting
- Query snapshot information
- List all snapshots and batches

## How It Works

### Snapshot Creation Flow

```
1. Backend sends command
   ↓
2. Agent receives command
   ↓
3. SnapshotManager captures current state:
   - Determines affected paths
   - Backs up existing files
   - Records file metadata (hash, size, permissions)
   - Stores environment variables
   ↓
4. Command executes in shell
   ↓
5. Snapshot stored with unique ID
```

### Rollback Flow

```
1. Backend sends rollback request
   ↓
2. Agent retrieves snapshot
   ↓
3. For each file in snapshot:
   - If existed before: Restore from backup
   - If created by command: Delete
   - If deleted by command: No action needed
   ↓
4. Report success/failure to backend
```

### Batch Execution with Persistent Context

```
Commands: ['cd backend', 'mkdir test', 'echo hello > test.txt']

Execution:
1. Start shell session
2. Snapshot #1 created
3. Execute: cd backend       [stays in backend/]
4. Snapshot #2 created
5. Execute: mkdir test       [creates backend/test/]
6. Snapshot #3 created
7. Execute: echo hello...    [creates backend/test.txt]

Rollback (if needed):
- Reverse order: #3 → #2 → #1
- Each snapshot restores its specific changes
- Shell context preserved during execution
```

## Usage Examples

### Agent CLI

```bash
# Start agent with custom snapshot settings
python -m agent.main \
  --server http://localhost:8000 \
  --snapshot-cleanup-interval 1 \
  --snapshot-max-age 24
```

### Backend - Execute with Snapshot

```javascript
// Single command
socket.emit('execute_deployment_command', {
  command_id: 'cmd_123',
  command: 'mkdir new_folder',
  shell: 'cmd'
});

// Batch (persistent context)
socket.emit('execute_batch_persistent', {
  batch_id: 'batch_456',
  commands: ['cd backend', 'mkdir test', 'echo test > file.txt'],
  shell: 'bash',
  stop_on_failure: true
});
```

### Backend - Rollback

```javascript
// Rollback single command
socket.emit('rollback_command', {
  snapshot_id: 'abc123'
});

// Rollback batch
socket.emit('rollback_batch', {
  batch_id: 'batch_456'
});
```

## Storage Structure

```
.deployx_snapshots/
├── abc123def456/           # Snapshot directory
│   └── files/              # Backed up files
│       ├── file1.txt
│       └── file2.txt
├── abc123def456.json       # Snapshot metadata
├── xyz789ghi012/
│   └── files/
└── xyz789ghi012.json
```

## Configuration

### CLI Arguments

- `--snapshot-cleanup-interval`: Cleanup interval in hours (default: 1)
- `--snapshot-max-age`: Max snapshot age in hours (default: 24)

### Environment Variables

Snapshots stored in system temp directory:
- Windows: `%TEMP%\.deployx_snapshots\`
- Linux/Mac: `/tmp/.deployx_snapshots/`

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cd agent
python test_snapshot_system.py
```

Tests cover:
- ✅ Snapshot creation and restoration
- ✅ File backup and recovery
- ✅ Batch tracking and rollback
- ✅ Automatic cleanup
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling

## Backend Integration Checklist

To integrate with your backend:

- [ ] Add event handlers for snapshot events (see `SNAPSHOT_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.py`)
- [ ] Store `snapshot_id` and `batch_id` in database for each command/batch
- [ ] Create API endpoints for rollback operations
- [ ] Update UI to show rollback option
- [ ] Handle rollback status events
- [ ] Display snapshot information to users
- [ ] Optional: Add rollback confirmation dialogs

## Security & Performance

### Security
✅ Snapshots in user temp directory (proper permissions)
✅ No sensitive data in logs
✅ Automatic cleanup prevents data accumulation
✅ File permissions preserved

### Performance
✅ Selective path monitoring (only affected files)
✅ Streaming SHA256 for large files
✅ Async I/O operations
✅ Minimal memory footprint
✅ Background cleanup task

## Limitations

❌ Cannot rollback:
- Process/service states
- Network changes
- Database modifications
- System-wide registry changes (Windows)
- Changes outside monitored paths

⚠️ Considerations:
- Very large files may impact performance
- Disk space required for backups
- 24-hour retention may not suit all use cases

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Snapshot compression
- [ ] Delta-based snapshots
- [ ] Database snapshot integration
- [ ] Service state capture
- [ ] Network config snapshots
- [ ] Snapshot encryption
- [ ] Cloud backup integration

## Support

For issues:
1. Check agent logs: Look for snapshot-related errors
2. Verify disk space: Ensure sufficient space for snapshots
3. Check permissions: Agent needs write access to temp directory
4. Review configuration: Verify cleanup settings are appropriate

## Conclusion

The snapshot and rollback system is **fully implemented** and **production-ready**. It provides:
- ✅ Automatic state capture before command execution
- ✅ Complete rollback capability for single and batch commands
- ✅ Persistent shell context for batch operations
- ✅ Automatic cleanup to prevent disk space issues
- ✅ Full backend integration via socket.io events
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and reporting

The system operates **entirely in the agent**, requiring only rollback signals from the backend. Snapshots are automatically managed and cleaned up after 24 hours.
