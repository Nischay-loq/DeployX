# ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress implementing the auto-updating agent system.

---

## Phase 1: Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

- [ ] Install PyInstaller: `pip install -r Exe/requirements.txt`
- [ ] **Windows**: Install Inno Setup from https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
- [ ] **Linux**: Install dpkg-dev: `sudo apt install dpkg-dev`
- [ ] **macOS**: Install Xcode CLI: `xcode-select --install`
- [ ] Read `QUICK_START.md`
- [ ] (Optional) Add icons to `Exe/assets/`

---

## Phase 2: Build First Executable üèóÔ∏è

### Windows
- [ ] Navigate to `Exe/build/windows`
- [ ] Run `python build_windows.py`
- [ ] Note the SHA256 checksum printed
- [ ] Verify output: `output/DeployXAgent-Setup-1.0.0.exe`

### Linux (if applicable)
- [ ] Navigate to `Exe/build/linux`
- [ ] Make script executable: `chmod +x build_linux.sh`
- [ ] Run `./build_linux.sh`
- [ ] Note the SHA256 checksum
- [ ] Verify output: `deployx-agent_1.0.0_amd64.deb`

### macOS (if applicable)
- [ ] Navigate to `Exe/build/macos`
- [ ] Make script executable: `chmod +x build_macos.sh`
- [ ] Run `./build_macos.sh`
- [ ] Note the SHA256 checksum
- [ ] Verify output: `DeployX-Agent-1.0.0.dmg`

---

## Phase 3: Test Installation üß™

### Windows Testing
- [ ] Run the installer
- [ ] Check "Start agent automatically" option
- [ ] Complete installation
- [ ] Verify service: `sc query DeployXAgent`
- [ ] Check logs: `C:\Program Files\DeployX Agent\deployx-agent.log`
- [ ] Verify "Checking for updates..." appears in logs
- [ ] Test agent connection to backend

### Linux Testing
- [ ] Install package: `sudo dpkg -i deployx-agent_1.0.0_amd64.deb`
- [ ] Check service: `sudo systemctl status deployx-agent`
- [ ] View logs: `sudo journalctl -u deployx-agent -f`
- [ ] Verify agent is running
- [ ] Test agent connection to backend

### macOS Testing
- [ ] Open DMG file
- [ ] Drag to Applications
- [ ] Launch from Applications
- [ ] Grant necessary permissions
- [ ] Check logs: `tail -f /tmp/deployx-agent.log`
- [ ] Test agent connection to backend

---

## Phase 4: Backend Integration üåê

- [ ] Create directory: `mkdir backend/agent_updates`
- [ ] Edit `backend/app/main.py` to add update routes:
  ```python
  import sys
  from pathlib import Path
  sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "Exe" / "backend_routes"))
  from agent_updates import router as updates_router
  app.include_router(updates_router)
  ```
- [ ] Copy versions.json: `cp Exe/backend_routes/versions.json backend/agent_updates/`
- [ ] Update checksums in `backend/agent_updates/versions.json`
- [ ] Copy built installers to `backend/agent_updates/`
- [ ] Start backend server
- [ ] Test update check endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:8000/api/agent/updates/check?current_version=0.9.0&platform=win32"
  ```
- [ ] Verify response shows update available

---

## Phase 5: Test Auto-Update üîÑ

- [ ] Install agent version 1.0.0
- [ ] Verify agent checks for updates (within 60 seconds)
- [ ] Check logs show "Agent is up to date"
- [ ] Update `Exe/version.py` to "1.0.1"
- [ ] Rebuild installer for your platform
- [ ] Copy new installer to `backend/agent_updates/`
- [ ] Calculate SHA256 and update `versions.json`
- [ ] Update version number in `versions.json`
- [ ] Wait up to 1 hour (or restart agent)
- [ ] Verify agent downloads update
- [ ] Verify agent installs update
- [ ] Verify agent restarts with version 1.0.1
- [ ] Check logs confirm successful update

---

## Phase 6: Production Deployment üöÄ

- [ ] Update `Exe/config/config.json` with production server URL
- [ ] Rebuild with production configuration
- [ ] Test installers on clean machines
- [ ] Upload installers to production server
- [ ] Deploy backend with update routes
- [ ] Verify production update endpoint is accessible
- [ ] Test update from production server
- [ ] Create download page/links for users
- [ ] Write installation instructions for users
- [ ] (Optional) Create GitHub release

---

## Phase 7: Documentation & Distribution üìö

- [ ] Document installation process for end users
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add download links to website/README
- [ ] Set up monitoring for update downloads
- [ ] Create support documentation
- [ ] Plan release schedule
- [ ] (Optional) Set up automated builds with CI/CD

---

## Optional Enhancements üåü

- [ ] Add custom application icons
- [ ] Set up code signing (Windows/macOS)
- [ ] Create installer for other Linux distributions (.rpm)
- [ ] Add telemetry for update success tracking
- [ ] Implement staged rollouts (10% -> 50% -> 100%)
- [ ] Add rollback mechanism
- [ ] Create installer customization (company branding)
- [ ] Set up CDN for faster downloads
- [ ] Add release notes display in agent
- [ ] Create automatic build pipeline
