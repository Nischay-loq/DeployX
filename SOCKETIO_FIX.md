# ✅ Socket.IO Compatibility Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue
Agent was crashing on startup with error:
```
TypeError: BaseClient.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ping_interval'
AttributeError: 'AsyncClient' object has no attribute 'http'
```

## Root Cause
The `python-socketio` library version 5.x doesn't support the following parameters in `AsyncClient()`:
- `randomization_factor`
- `ping_interval`
- `ping_timeout`

These parameters were causing the initialization to fail.

## Solution Applied

### File: `agent/core/connection.py`

**Removed incompatible parameters:**
```python
# BEFORE (caused error):
self.sio = socketio.AsyncClient(
    logger=False,
    engineio_logger=False,
    reconnection=True,
    reconnection_attempts=0,
    reconnection_delay=1,
    reconnection_delay_max=5,
    randomization_factor=0,      # ❌ Not supported
    ping_interval=25,             # ❌ Not supported
    ping_timeout=60               # ❌ Not supported
)

# AFTER (works correctly):
self.sio = socketio.AsyncClient(
    logger=False,
    engineio_logger=False,
    reconnection=True,
    reconnection_attempts=0,
    reconnection_delay=1,
    reconnection_delay_max=5
    # Removed incompatible parameters
)
```

### File: `agent/requirements.txt`

**Updated to specify minimum versions:**
```
zeroconf
python-socketio[asyncio]>=5.9.0  # Added version requirement
aiohttp>=3.8.5                   # Added version requirement
psutil>=5.9.5                    # Added version requirement
requests>=2.31.0                 # Added version requirement
uvloop; sys_platform != "win32"
```

## Verification

Agent now starts successfully:
```
✅ INFO - Generated agent ID: agent_86d54f2b
✅ INFO - Successfully connected to backend
✅ INFO - Detected shells: {'cmd', 'powershell', 'bash'}
✅ INFO - Successfully registered with backend as agent_86d54f2b
```

## Packages Upgraded

The following packages were upgraded during the fix:
- `python-socketio`: 5.12.1 → 5.14.1
- `zeroconf`: 0.147.0 → 0.148.0
- `psutil`: 7.0.0 → 7.1.0
- `requests`: 2.32.3 → 2.32.5

## Notes

- The ping functionality is handled automatically by the underlying `engine.io` library
- Connection keep-alive works without explicit `ping_interval`/`ping_timeout` parameters
- Reconnection logic is still fully functional with the remaining parameters

## Files Modified

1. `agent/core/connection.py` - Removed incompatible AsyncClient parameters
2. `agent/requirements.txt` - Added version constraints for dependencies

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Agent connects successfully without errors
