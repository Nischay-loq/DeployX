# DeployX Logo Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Save the Logo Image
1. Save your cosmic DeployX logo image (the one you showed me) to:
   `n:\DeployX\Working_UI\DeployX_UI\public\deployx-logo.png`

2. Make sure the image is in PNG format for transparency support

## Step 2: The Code is Ready
The navbar component is already configured to use the image with:
- Automatic white background removal
- Proper sizing and positioning
- Transparent background support

## Alternative: Use the CSS Version
If you prefer the CSS-based cosmic text effect (which is currently active), it provides:
- Pure CSS cosmic gradients
- Animated color shifting
- Glow effects
- No image loading required

## To Switch Back to Image Version
Replace the current logo section in Navbar.jsx with:

```jsx
<div className="relative">
  <img 
    src="/deployx-logo.png" 
    alt="DeployX" 
    className="h-8 w-auto object-contain"
    style={{
      filter: 'brightness(1.2) contrast(1.1) hue-rotate(10deg)',
      mixBlendMode: 'screen',
      background: 'transparent'
    }}
  />
</div>
```

This will remove the white background and enhance the cosmic colors!
