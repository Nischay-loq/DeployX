# Issues Fixed ✅

## Issue #1: 405 Method Not Allowed Error ✅

### Problem
When clicking the Schedule button, got error:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 405 (Method Not Allowed)
Error creating scheduled task: AxiosError
Scheduling error: Error: Method Not Allowed
```

### Root Cause
The backend server was not restarted after adding schedule routes, or schedule tables weren't created.

### Solution Applied
✅ Database tables created using `python create_schedule_tables.py`
```
✓ scheduled_tasks
✓ scheduled_task_executions
```

### How to Fix (If Still Having Issues)

**Step 1: Stop and Restart Backend**
```powershell
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd D:\DeployX\backend
python start_server.py
```

**Step 2: Verify Logs Show:**
```
Task scheduler started
Loaded existing scheduled tasks
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

**Step 3: Test the API**
```powershell
# In a new PowerShell terminal:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/health" -Method GET
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","message":"Backend is running"}
```

## Issue #2: File Deployment Schedule Button Disabled ✅

### Problem
Schedule button in File Deployment page was disabled even when files were uploaded and devices were selected, if custom path was not entered.

### Root Cause
The `canDeploy()` function was checking for `customPath.trim()` which made the custom path mandatory.

### Solution Applied
✅ **Fixed FileSystemManager.jsx:**

**Before:**
```javascript
const canDeploy = () => {
  return uploadedFiles.length > 0 && 
         (selectedGroups.length > 0 || selectedDevices.length > 0) &&
         customPath.trim();  // ❌ Made path mandatory
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const canDeploy = () => {
  return uploadedFiles.length > 0 && 
         (selectedGroups.length > 0 || selectedDevices.length > 0);
         // ✅ Custom path is optional
};

const openSchedulingModal = () => {
  // Use default path if custom path is not provided
  const deploymentPath = customPath.trim() || '/tmp/deployed_files';
  // ... rest of code
};
```

**Button Enable Conditions Changed:**
```javascript
// Before:
disabled={isDeploying || uploadedFiles.length === 0 || getTargetDevices().length === 0 || !customPath.trim()}

// After:
disabled={isDeploying || uploadedFiles.length === 0 || getTargetDevices().length === 0}
```

### Now Works Like This:
- ✅ Upload files
- ✅ Select devices/groups
- ✅ Schedule button becomes enabled
- ✅ If no custom path is entered, uses default: `/tmp/deployed_files`
- ✅ If custom path is entered, uses that path

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/components/FileSystemManager.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Removed `customPath.trim()` requirement from `canDeploy()`
- Added default path fallback in `openSchedulingModal()`
- Updated button disabled condition
- Schedule button now works with or without custom path

### 2. `backend/create_schedule_tables.py`
**Action:** Executed successfully
- Created `scheduled_tasks` table
- Created `scheduled_task_executions` table

## Quick Fix Commands

If you're still getting the 405 error:

```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd D:\DeployX\backend
pip install apscheduler                 # If not installed
python create_schedule_tables.py        # Create tables
python start_server.py                  # Start server

# Wait for "Task scheduler started" message

# Terminal 2 - Test
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/health" -Method GET

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd D:\DeployX\frontend
npm run dev
```

## Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:

✅ Backend logs show:
```
Task scheduler started
