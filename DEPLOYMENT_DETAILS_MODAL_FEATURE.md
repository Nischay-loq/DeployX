## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// New deployment modal states
const [showDeploymentModal, setShowDeploymentModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedDeployment, setSelectedDeployment] = useState(null);
const [deploymentDevices, setDeploymentDevices] = useState([]);
const [deploymentGroups, setDeploymentGroups] = useState([]);
const [loadingDeploymentDetails, setLoadingDeploymentDetails] = useState(false);
```

### Deployment Details Fetching
```javascript
const fetchDeploymentDetails = async (deployment) => {
  // Fetches comprehensive deployment information
  // Handles API calls and fallback data
  // Updates modal state with deployment details
  // Includes error handling and loading states
};
```

### API Integration
- **Primary**: Attempts to fetch from `/deployments/{id}` endpoint
- **Fallback**: Uses provided deployment data when API is unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful error messages
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper request timeout management

## üé® Modal Design Features

### Header Section:
- **Deployment Name**: Clear title with deployment identifier
- **Status Badge**: Color-coded status indicator (success/failed/pending)

- **Responsive Table**: Horizontal scroll on smaller screens

### Groups Section:
- **Card Layout**: Clean grid of group information cards
- **Metrics Display**: Device counts and success rates
- **Color Coding**: Consistent with overall dashboard theme

## üìä Data Structure Handled

      version: "2.1.0",
      installation_path: "/opt/myapp/",
      size: "45.2 MB"
    }
  ],
  target_devices: [
    {
      device_name: "Server-01",
      ip_address: "192.168.1.10",
      status: "online",
      deployment_status: "success"
    }
  ],
  target_groups: [
    {
      group_name: "Production Servers",
      device_count: 5,
      success_rate: "80%"
    }
  ]
}
```
